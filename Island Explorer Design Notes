==Map==
IslandMap has two HashMaps: HashMap<Point, Tile>) and HashMap<Tile, Point>
IslandMap knows what the current position is.
IslandMap does not know where front is (the direction we are facing).
IslandMap only uses absolute directions AbsoluteDirection (North, East, South, West)

IslandMap absolute navigation methods:
	getTile(Point point) => returns the tile at the given coordinates
	getTile(Point reference, AbsDir, range) => returns the tile that is <range> distance to the <AbsDir> of the referece coordinates.
	getTiles (Point reference, AbsDir, range) => returns all the tiles in a straight line to the <AbsDir> up to <range> distance away from the reference coordinates.
	getSurroundingTiles (Tile referemce) => returns the tiles surrounding the reference coordinates (does not include the tile at the reference coordinate).
	updateTile(Tile)?
	getX (Tile tile) => returns the x-coordinate of the given tile
	getY (Tile tile) => returns the y-coordinate of the given tile
	
==Navigator==
Knows the direction we are facing.	
Uses relative direction (Front, Left, Right, Back)

Navigator relative navigation methods:
	getCurrentTile() => returns the tile at the current position
	getTile(direction) => get the adjacent tile in the given <direction>
	getTiles(direction, range) => get the tile that is <range> distance in the given <direction>


==Actions==
=Phase 1=
fly => forward x3

Heading: 
	right => forward x3, right x3
	left => forward x3, left x3
	
Echo: 
When echoing, the range returned represents 3 tiles. 

if ground is detected and range is 5, then there are 15 tiles in the echo direction that are sea, and the tiles at range 15 + 1 is ground. Three tiles are set to ground, because we assume the echo hits three tiles:

drone     echo     ground
	    ))))))))))))|						
 -> ))))))))))))))))|
	    ))))))))))))|
 

If out_of_range is detected and range is 10, then the map is (10 + 1) * 3 tiles wide/long. The reason for +1 is that the current position of the drone is not counted in the range.
